# greaselm

## Overview

The GreaseLM model was proposed in [GreaseLM: Graph REASoning Enhanced Language Models for Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.08860) by Xikun Zhang, Antoine Bosselut, Michihiro Yasunaga, Hongyu Ren, Percy Liang, Christopher D. Manning, Jure Leskovec.
GreaseLM enables the fusion and exchange of information from the language model and the knowledge graph (KG) in multiple
layers of its architecture. GreaseLM takes as input the natural language context and a graph neural network that reasons
over the KG, ultimately demonstrating superior results in commonsense reasoning.

The abstract from the paper is the following:

Answering complex questions about textual narratives requires reasoning over both stated context and the world
knowledge that underlies it. However, pretrained language models (LM), the foundation of most modern QA systems,
do not robustly represent latent relationships between concepts, which is necessary for reasoning. While knowledge
graphs (KG) are often used to augment LMs with structured representations of world knowledge, it remains an open
question how to effectively fuse and reason over the KG representations and the language context, which provides
situational constraints and nuances. In this work, we propose GreaseLM, a new model that fuses encoded representations
from pretrained LMs and graph neural networks over multiple layers of modality interaction operations. Information
from both modalities propagates to the other, allowing language context representations to be grounded by structured
world knowledge, and allowing linguistic nuances (e.g., negation, hedging) in the context to inform the graph
representations of knowledge. Our results on three benchmarks in the commonsense reasoning (i.e., CommonsenseQA,
OpenbookQA) and medical question answering (i.e., MedQA-USMLE) domains demonstrate that GreaseLM can more reliably
answer questions that require reasoning over both situational constraints and structured knowledge, even outperforming
models 8x larger.

Tips:

```python

from transformers import GreaseLMProcessor, GreaseLMForMultipleChoice
device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"

def index_to_answer(index, choices=["A", "B", "C", "D", "E"]):
    return choices[index]

proc = GreaseLMProcessor.from_pretrained("Xikun/greaselm-csqa")

model = GreaseLMForMultipleChoice.from_pretrained("Xikun/greaselm-csqa")
_ = model.to(device)
_ = model.eval()

csqa = {"answerKey": "A", "id": "1afa02df02c908a558b4036e80242fac",

                                 {"label": "E", "text": "new york"}],
                     "stem": "A revolving door is convenient for two direction travel, but it also serves as a security measure at a what?"}}

batch = proc(csqa)

output = model(**batch.to(device))
labels = batch["labels"]

results = output.logits.argmax(1) == labels
for idx, r in enumerate(results):
  model_answer = index_to_answer(output.logits.argmax(1)[idx].item())
  correct_answer = index_to_answer(labels[idx].item())
  if r:
     print(f"For the question {idx}, model answered correctly, answer is {model_answer}")
  else:
     print(f"For the question {idx}, model answered incorrectly, answer is not {model_answer} but {correct_answer}")
